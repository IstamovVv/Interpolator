# Health Calculator

At the moment am working on this project. I started working on it in mid-May 2021. Here I will implement an application that allows you to calculate the compliance of your diet with the daily norm. In the future, it will be possible to choose seasonal products relative to a specific region, so that the diet can be made as cheaply as possible.

## Current capabilities

So far, the program provides an opportunity to select a list of products and see the set of nutrients contained in it.

## Future capabilities

In the future, there will be a separate block with a world map.
It will be possible to select a region and season of the year.
After that, you will be presented with a list of seasonal products in this region that can maintain your daily intake of nutrients.
